Requirements
============

  POSIX systems (e.g. Linux, OS X):
  ---------------------------------

  You need at least to have libtool installed to be able to build the
  library with "./configure && make".

Compiling
=========

  Call './configure && make' on the console to compile the library, all
  tools and demo applications, documentation and install them with
  'make install'. The latter has to be called as root.

  If you are compiling from CVS you have to call 'make -f Makefile.cvs'
  to generate all autotools build files before calling
  './configure && make'.

  You can use 'make distclean' and probably 'make -f Makefile.cvs clean'
  to clean up everything again. The latter will also delete all automatic
  generated autools build files.
